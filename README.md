SynthCursor 🎶

SynthCursor is an interactive audio-visual synthesizer built with openFrameworks.
It lets you control sound in real time using your mouse and keyboard, while the visuals respond dynamically to your interaction.

What It Does

Mouse X controls pitch

Mouse Y controls volume

Keys 1, 2, 3 switch between Sine, Square, and Saw waves

The waveform animates continuously

The background and colors react to interaction

A glowing cursor trail makes the interface feel alive

The goal was to connect sound and visuals so they feel like one responsive system.

Why we built this?

This project explores:

Real-time sound generation

Mapping user input to audio parameters

Creating dynamic visual feedback

Making interaction feel smooth and intuitive

It started as a simple synthesizer and evolved into a more expressive audio-visual experience.
